# Imagination Field Concept

The imagination field is modeled as a dynamic visual space where:

- The **iris** represents focus
- **Particles** represent flowing thoughts
- **Fractals** represent higher-order imagination activation
- Energy level controls density and complexity

This model can be extended to:
- AI perception visualization
- Meditation interfaces
- Creative coding experiments
