# 🌌 Imagination Field Concept

## Overview
The Imagination Field Simulator is a symbolic visualization system that represents
internal perception, imagination, and energy flow through dynamic visual elements.

This project is **conceptual and artistic**, not scientific or medical.

## Core Elements

### 1. Central Iris
The iris represents the point of focus or awareness.
Its size and glow respond to the symbolic energy level.

### 2. Particle Field
Particles represent flowing thoughts or imaginative fragments.
Higher energy levels increase particle density and motion.

### 3. Energy Axis
The energy slider acts as a symbolic internal parameter,
influencing complexity and intensity of the field.

### 4. Imagination Scan Mode
When activated, higher-order fractal patterns appear,
symbolizing deeper imagination or creative activation.

## Inspiration
This system draws inspiration from:
- Human imagination and perception metaphors
- Creative AI visualization
- Ancient symbolism interpreted digitally
- Generative art systems

---

## Limitations
- No neurological, medical, or psychological claims are made
- This system does not read thoughts or emotions
- It is a **visual metaphor only**

---

## Possible Extensions
- Audio-reactive imagination fields
- AI-driven particle behavior
- Web-based (Three.js) versions
- Interactive meditation or creative tools

---

## Philosophy
Imagination is treated here not as data,
but as **movement, flow, and resonance**.
